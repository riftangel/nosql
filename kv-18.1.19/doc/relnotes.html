<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
Oracle NoSQL Database is a distributed key-value store capable of scaling
horizontally to handle very large amounts of data.
</p>
<p>
The Oracle NoSQL Database server is compatible with Java SE 8 (64-bit),
and the client is compatible with Java SE 8. Both the client and server
have been tested and certified against Oracle Java SE 8 Update 161.  We
encourage you to upgrade to the latest Java 8 release to take advantage
of the latest bug fixes and performance improvements.  We expect to
certify Oracle NoSQL Database with more recent Java major versions in a
future release.
</p>
<p>
Attempting to use this release with a version of Java earlier than the
required version will produce an error message similar to:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError:
  oracle/kv/impl/util/KVStoreMain : Unsupported major.minor version 52.0
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="release">This Release</a></h2>
<p>
This is release 18.1.19 Community Edition of Oracle NoSQL Database.  It follows
major release 4.0.9 and minor release 18.1.13.
</p>
<h3>Differences between 18.1.19 Community Edition and Release 18.1.13</h3>
<p>
Release 18.1.19 Community Edition of Oracle NoSQL Database is a patch
release. We strongly recommend that users of earlier versions upgrade to
this release.  For a complete listing of all the changes made to Oracle
NoSQL Database for this release (including all bug fixes) see
the <a href="changelog.html">change log</a>.
</p>
<h2><a name="features">New Features</a></h2>
<!-- Descriptions major features for the initial major release and
     subsequent minor releases, in reverse order -->
<h3>New in Release 18.1</h3>
<H4>Support for Group-by and Aggregate Function</h4>
<p>
This release introduces support for the group-by clause and the
following aggregate functions: count(*), count(expr), sum(expr),
avg(expr), min(expr) and max (expr).
</p>
<H4>Joining Tables in the Same Table Hierarchy</h4>
<p>
Support for joining tables that belong to the same table hierarchy &mdash;
parent-child table joins &mdash; is now available.
</p>
<H4>Zone Affinity</h4>
<p>
Users can specify master affinity for the primary zones that are in
close proximity to the client application. This feature allows the
system to favor placing master nodes in primary zones that have master
affinity set so that write operations are directed to nearby zones for
more predictable latency.
</p>
<h3>New in Release 4.5</h3>
<H4>Introducing Streaming API for tables</h4>
<p>
Oracle NoSQL Database provides a Streams API that allows users to
subscribe to changes made to tables by puts, updates and deletes. This
new API is based on the Reactive Streams standard
(http://www.reactive-streams.org).  Applications that use the Stream API
need to be compiled with Java SE Development Kit 8, and
require <code>kvstore.jar</code> for both compilation and at runtime.
</p>
<H4>Introducing C# Driver</h4>
<p>
The Oracle NoSQL Database C# driver allows native C# applications to access data
stored in Oracle NoSQL Database tables using the
basic <code>get</code>, <code>put</code>, and <code>search</code>
operations.
</p>
<H4>Support for UPDATE in SQL query</h4>
<p>
Added UPDATE statement support to perform single-row server-side updates
with SQL. The UPDATE command syntax supports the standard SET clause, as
well as extensions to support ADD, REMOVE and PUT clauses for adding and
removing elements and fields to/from arrays and maps. The existing
Oracle NoSQL Database path expression can be used to identify the target fields
to update both inside JSON datatype or in the strongly typed datatypes.
</p>
<H4>Disk usage enforcement using storage directory size parameter</h4>
<p>
The storage directory size parameter is now used to enforce disk
usage. Starting with this release, if the storage disk size is not
specified for replication nodes (RNs), the Oracle NoSQL Database storage
engine may use all available free disk space except for 5GB of reserved
free space. We strongly recommend that all applications:
<ul>
<li>Specify storage directories and sizes for all RNs, and
<li>Monitor disk usage using the new availableLogSize statistic and
take correction action well before this value reaches zero.
</ul>
<p>
Write operations will be rejected and only read operations will be allowed
when the storage size is in danger of being exceeded.
</p>
<H4>5GB minimum disk space requirement </h4>
<p>
Starting with this release, a minimum of 5GB disk space is required for the
<code>kvlite</code> and <code>kvstore</code> service to start.
</p>
<h3>New in Release 4.4</h3>
<H4>Introducing indexing capability for JSON data</h4>
<p>
Starting this release, Oracle NoSQL Database supports typed JSON
indexes. The user can create an index on a field that is of JSON
datatype. A type (string, numeric,..) must be specified for a
JSON index and the system enforces the semantics for that type
during SQL query processing.
</p>
<H4>SQL for NoSQL Enhancements</h4>
<p>
Added support for NUMBER datatype and all query expressions that work
on numeric values have been extended to work on NUMBER. Added support
for IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators in SQL for NoSQL.
</p>
<h3>New in Release 4.3</h3>
<H4>Oracle NoSQL Database Community Edition (CE) License Change</h4>
<p>
 Oracle NoSQL Database server Community Edition (CE) is now released
 under Apache License, Version 2.0 (Apache 2.0). Previously it was
 released under the Affero General Public License (aGPL v3). The
 licenses for the other distributions are unchanged.
</p>
<h4>Oracle NoSQL Database will create secure stores by default</h4>
<p>
Starting this release, Oracle NoSQL Database will create all stores as
secure stores by default, including those created by
<code>kvlite</code>. The user will have to set
the <code>-store-security</code> option to <code>none</code> in
the <code>makebootconfig</code> to create non-secure
stores. For <code>kvlite</code>, use <code>-secure-config disable</code>
option to create non-secure store.
</p>
<h4>Support for querying JSON data type fields</h4>
<p>
SQL for Oracle NoSQL Database now supports querying and manipulating
data stored as JSON data types in its DML queries. Creating and storing
fields of type JSON was introduced in the previous release as a preview
and is now made available as general release. Indexed JSON queries are
not supported in this release and as a result some queries may experience
performance issues.
</p>
<h4>Introducing TIMESTAMP data type</h4>
<p>
Users can create a table of type TIMESTAMP using the TABLE API and can
query fields of type TIMESTAMP using the SQL for Oracle NoSQL query
language.
</p>
<h4>Storage Engine (JE) Stats available through JMX</h4>
<p>
Storage Engine (JE) statistics that are written to the
&lt;kvroot>/log/&lt;storename&gt;.stats and
&lt;kvroot&gt;/log/&lt;storename&gt;.perf files are now made available
through the Oracle NoSQL JMX agent via the standard
javax.management.Notification mechanism in JSON format. This allows
users to make a single call to obtain all the JE stats for a particular
component as opposed to a call for every JE stat.
</p>
<h4>Increased parallelism in Predicate Push Down</h4>
<p>
The Predicate Push Down feature has been enhanced so that when the input
splits are generated (on the client side), partition and shard
information is now employed to produce splits that are distributed to
the Datanodes of the Hadoop cluster. This enhancement results in optimum
parallelization of the predicate filtering that is performed on the
Oracle NoSQL Database server.
</p>
<h4>Removal of SNMP monitoring and the web-based Admin console</h4>
<p>
With this release, Oracle NoSQL Database no longer supports monitoring
via SNMP, nor does it provide a web-based console for directly
monitoring a store with a web browser.  JMX monitoring is still
supported.
</p>
<h3>New in Release 4.2</h3>
<h4>Storage Directory Based Topology Layout</h4>
<p>
Topology layout now takes storage directory size information into
account.  If storage directory sizes have been specified for Storage
Nodes, then the deploy, rebalance, redistribute, and contract topology
commands will adjust shards and partitions to take directory sizes into
account.
</p>
<h4>Improved Write Availability With RF=2</h4>
<p>
Stores with replication factor 2 can now continue to support writes
after single node failures if the store includes Arbiter nodes, a new
type of lightweight node that allows the system to select a master if
one of the two replication nodes in a shard becomes unavailable.
Arbiters can be used to improve availability without increasing the
number of data replicas maintained by the store.
</p>
<h4>Store Contraction</h4>
<p>
The new <code>topology contract</code> command makes it possible to
reduce the size of a store by eliminating storage nodes and reducing the
number of shards.  The replication factor is not changed.
</p>
<h4>General Release of Query and Full Text Search</h4>
<p>
The query language and full text search are now general release
features.
</p>
<h4>Preview release of API support for a JSON data type</h4>
<p>
Limited support for declaring and using a JSON data type is provided
as a preview release. See the
<a href="changelog.html">change log</a> for  more information.
</p>
<h3>New in Release 4.0</h3>
<h4>Query</h4>
<p>
Added a preview release of an SQL-style declarative query language to
support server side predicates, filtering, and projection of table
data. The new features include the language itself, APIs for querying
and results handling, as well as a new interactive shell to exercise
queries.
</p>
<h4>Full Text Search</h4>
<p>
Added a preview release of integration with Elasticsearch to provide
full text search indexing.  Text indexes can be added to tables in
Oracle NoSQL Database, which will cause a corresponding index in an
attached Elasticsearch cluster to be populated and maintained.
</p>
<h4>TTL</h4>
<p>
Added support for Time-To-Live (TTL), which allows applications to
request automatic purging of records after a given time interval.  A
default TTL can be specified for all entries in a table, and a TTL value
can also be specified for individual table operations.  For applications
whose data should expire over time, the TTL feature provides better
performance than deleting records explicitly.
</p>
<h4>Export/Import Utility</h4>
<p>
Added Export and Import utilities. The new utilities allows users to
export the contents from Oracle NoSQL Database store to either the local
file system or to the Oracle Storage Cloud Service, and to import
contents from the locations into an Oracle NoSQL Database store.
</p>
<h2><a name="distributions">Distributions</a></h2>
<p>
    Oracle NoSQL Database comes in four distributions:
    Community Edition (CE), Enterprise Edition (EE), Basic Edition (BE),
    and Client.
</p>
<p>
    The CE version is open source. It ships with source code and is
    released under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (Apache 2.0). It
    includes the client and server distribution, but does not include
    some server features.
</p>
<p>
    The EE version does not include source code and it ships with an
    Oracle license. The EE version includes the client and server
    distribution, and includes several features not found in the CE
    version: Oracle External Tables support, Oracle Wallet support for
    external password storage, and support for Kerberos authentication.
</p>
<p>
    The BE version only contains the server and is distributed under the
    Oracle Database Enterprise Edition license. The BE version does not
    include source code, and is functionally identical to CE.
</p>
<p>
    The Client version is open source. It ships with source code and is
    released under the Apache 2.0 License (Apache 2.0).  The Client
    version only contains the implementation of the client API, which
    may be used to access servers running under CE, EE, or BE.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, example code is provided in its own package, which can be
  used with any of the three main distributions.
</p>
<h2><a name="building">Building from Source Code in the Community
Edition</a></h2>
<p>
If you have downloaded the Community Edition, you can use the included
Ant build script to rebuild JAR files if you make source changes.
</p>
<p>
You need Apache Ant version 1.9.0 or later in order to do builds.  You
can download Ant from:
</p>
<blockquote>
http://ant.apache.org/
</blockquote>
<p>
You also need Apache Ivy for loading dependencies.  You can download Ivy
from:
</p>
<blockquote>
http://ant.apache.org/ivy/
</blockquote>
<p>
Make sure to add the ivy JAR file to your <tt>~/.ant/lib</tt> directory
or specify the ivy directory using the ant <tt>-lib</tt> option.
</p>
<p>
The default Ant target will rebuild all JAR files.
</p>
<h2><a name="issues">Known Issues</a></h2>
<h3>Memory Allocation Algorithm Fails to Account for Java Memory
  Overhead, Can Produce OutOfMemoryErrors</h3>
<p>
The automatic memory allocation algorithm in NoSQL Database currently
fails to account correctly for the additional memory that the Java
virtual machine uses beyond the requested maximum heap size.  The
additional memory usage varies depending on the application, but a 25%
overhead is probably common.
</p>
<p>
To achieve the recommended standard memory allocation, which uses up to
85% of memory for Java virtual machines running replication nodes,
reserves 10% for the operating system, and uses the remaining 5% or more
for the off-heap cache, make the changes to SN parameters described
below.
</p>
<p>
The changes to make depend on the amount of memory available and the
capacity of the SN, that is, the number of RNs it supports.
</p>
<p>
The first set of changes applies to hosts with less than 48 GB of memory
for each RN its SN supports.
</p>
<table border="1"
       summary="Table of capacity and memory values">
<caption><i>Capacity and Memory Table</i></caption>
<thead>
<tr><th>Capacity<th>Memory
<tbody>
<tr><td>1<td>48 GB
<tr><td>2<td>96 GB
<tr><td>3<td>144 GB
<tr><td>4<td>192 GB
</table>
<p>
For configurations with less than the amount of memory specified in the
Capacity and Memory table, set the memoryMB and rnHeapPercent SN
parameters as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Set memoryMB to 81% of the total available memory
<li>Set rnHeapPercent to 84%
</ol>
<p>
Note that we are using the GB and MB units to mean that 1 GB = 1000 MB.
</p>
<p>
For a new store, you can specify the value of the memoryMB parameter by
using the -memory_mb flag to the <code>makebootconfig</code> utility
command.  For information about this utility command, see
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/other-databases/nosql-database/18.1&id=NSADM-GUID-527622CE-F114-43F6-9012-AB245621DA00">
Utility Command Reference: makebootconfig</a>.
</p>
<p>
For general directions on how to set parameters, see
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/other-databases/nosql-database/18.1&id=NSADM-GUID-B6F7AE32-DD5D-4F6A-A4F6-BC576A10C2A0">
Setting Store Parameters</a>.
</p>
<p>
For information on particular SN parameters, see
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/other-databases/nosql-database/18.1&id=NSADM-GUID-E5F09161-ABD3-4F8A-8EF8-26271EB82116">
Storage Node Parameters</a>.
</p>
<p>
For example, on a machine with 16 GB of memory, set the memoryMB
parameter to:
</p>
<pre>
  memoryMB = totalMemory * 0.81
           = 16000 * 0.81
           = 12960
</pre>
<p>
Also set the rnHeapPercent parameter to 84.
</p>
<p>
For a new store, you can use the <code>makebootconfig</code> utility
command with the -memory_mb flag to set the memoryMB parameter when
deploying each SN, for example:
</p>
<pre>
  java -Xms64m -Xmx64m -jar KVHOME/lib/kvstore.jar makebootconfig \
       -root mykvroot -host myhost -port 5000 -harange 5010,5012 \
       -memory_mb 12960
</pre>
<p>
To set the rnHeapPercent parameter, you can specify the new value as a
policy parameter prior to deploying any of the SNs, which will cause the
new value to be used, by default, for all SNs.  You do this with the
<code>runadmin</code> utility command, using the change-policy CLI
command after deploying the store's zones and before deploying the SNs.
For example:
</p>
<pre>
  java -Xms64m -Xmx64m -jar KVHOME/lib/kvstore.jar runadmin \
       -host myhost -port 5000
  [...]
  kv-> plan deploy-zone -name zone1 -rf 3 -wait
  kv-> change-policy -params rnHeapPercent=84
  kv-> plan deploy-sn -znname zone1 -host myhost -port 5000 -wait
  [...]
</pre>
<p>
For an existing store, you can use the <code>runadmin</code> utility
command to change these parameters for each storage node.  For example,
to change the settings for sn1:
</p>
<pre>
  java -jar KVHOME/lib/kvstore.jar runadmin \
       -host myhost -port 5000 -security ~/login-properties \
       plan change-parameters -wait -service sn1 \
            -params memoryMB=12960 rnHeapPercent=84
</pre>
<p>
Then, whenever a new storage node is added, you can use either the
makebootconfig and change-policy approach, or the change-parameters one,
to update the new node's parameters.
</p>
<p>
With these new parameter settings in place, if the storage node has a
capacity of 1, the Java maximum heap size for the RN will be set to:
</p>
<pre>
  javaHeap = memoryMB * 0.84
           = 12.96 GB * 0.84
           = 10.89 GB
</pre>
<p>
With a 25% memory overhead, the amount of memory the Java virtual
machine will use will be:
</p>
<pre>
  totalJavaMemory = javaHeap * 1.25
                  = 10.89 * 1.25
                  = 13.61 GB
</pre>
<p>
That produces the following memory allocation:
</p>
<table border="1"
       summary="Table of memory amounts and uses">
<thead>
<tr><th>Size<th>Usage
<tbody>
<tr><td>13.61 GB<td>Java memory usage
<tr><td>0.77 GB<td>Off-heap cache
<tr><td>1.62 GB<td>System
<tr><td>16.00 GB<td>Total
</table>
<p>
Note that the memoryMB parameter limits the total amount of memory used
by the Java virtual machines for all RNs for the SN.  Setting the
memoryMB parameter to 81% of the total memory will correctly limit the
total Java memory size even if the SN supports multiple RNs because it
has a capacity greater than 1.
</p>
<p>
The second set of changes applies to hosts with 48 GB or more of memory
for each RN.
</p>
<p>
For configurations with more than the amount of memory specified in the
Capacity and Memory Table, set the memoryMB and systemPercent SN
parameters as follows.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Set memoryMB to totalMemoryInMB - (8000 * capacity)
<li>Set systemPercent to (10 * totalMemory) / (totalMemory - (8 * capacity))
</ol>
<p>
The default setting of rnHeapPercent (85) should be used.
</p>
<p>
For example, on a machine with 48 GB of memory and an SN capacity of 1,
set the memoryMB parameter to:
</p>
<pre>
  memoryMB = totalMemory - (8000 * capacity)
           = 48000 - (8000 * 1)
           = 40000
</pre>
<p>
Also set the systemPercent parameter to:
</p>
<pre>
  systemPercent = (10 * totalMemory) / (totalMemory - (8 * capacity))
                = (10 * 48) / (48 - (8 * 1))
                = 480 / 40
                = 12
</pre>
<p>
As with rnHeapPercent, systemPercent is a policy parameter, so it can be
set for all SNs by using the change-policy CLI command if all SNs are
configured the same way, or else should be set to the appropriate value
on each SN.
</p>
<p>
Those parameter settings produce the following memory allocation:
</p>
<table border="1"
       summary="Table of memory amounts and uses">
<thead>
<tr><th>Size<th>Usage
<tbody>
<tr><td>40.00 GB<td>Java memory usage
<tr><td>3.20 GB<td>Off-heap cache
<tr><td>4.80 GB<td>System
<tr><td>48.00 GB<td>Total
</table>
<p>
For one more example, on a machine with 192 GB of memory and an SN
capacity of 3, set the memoryMB parameter to:
</p>
<pre>
  memoryMB = totalMemory - (8000 * capacity)
           = 192000 - (8000 * 3)
           = 192000 - 24000
           = 168000
</pre>
<p>
Also set the systemPercent parameter to:
</p>
<pre>
  systemPercent = (10 * totalMemory) / (totalMemory - (8 * capacity))
                = (10 * 192) / (192 - (8 * 3))
                = 1920 / 168
                = 11.4
</pre>
<p>
Those parameter settings produce the following memory allocation:

</p>
<h3>Need a minimum of 5GB of free disk space to deploy a storage node
  that hosts an admin</h3>
<p>
If a Storage Node that hosts an admin is deployed on a system with less
than 5GB of free disk space, the following exception will occur:
</p>
<pre>
Connected to Admin in read-only mode
(JE 18.1.8) Database AdminSchemaVersion not found. (18.1.3)
</pre>
<p>
Make sure you have at least 5GB of free disk space to successfully
deploy a storage node.  This same problem will occur when deploying
KVLite.  We expect to remove this restriction in a future release.
</p>
[#26818]
<h3>Storage directory size may be incorrect when migrating a storage node</h3>
<p>
When migrating a storage node (SN) make sure that the target SN has
a directory size that is equal to or greater than the source SN.
The system currently does not make this check and the target SN may
have the wrong storage directory size. This is a bug that
will be fixed in a later release. You can do
</p>
<pre>
  show parameters -service snX
</pre>
<p>
on the source SN and target SN to determine the directory size.
</p>
<p>
[#26918]
</p>
<h3>Users must manage Admin directory size, can put all admins into
  "RUNNING,UNKNOWN" state</h3>
<p>
Starting with the 4.5.x release, every Admin is allocated a maximum of 3
GB of disk space by default, which is sufficient space for the vast
majority of installations. However, under some rare circumstances you
might want to change this 3 GB limit, especially if the Admin is sharing
a disk with a Storage Node. For more information, see
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/other-databases/nosql-database/18.1&id=GUID-3EB45F79-15F6-4300-A82B-1F23B9906DE6">

Size</a>.
</p>
<p>
If Admins run out of disk space, then there will be entries in the Admin
logs saying "Disk usage is not within je.maxDisk or je.freeDisk limits
and write operations are prohibited" and the output of the ping command
will show all the Admins in the "RUNNING,UNKNOWN" state. Follow the
procedure described in
<a href="https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/other-databases/nosql-database/18.1&id=GUID-3EB45F79-15F6-4300-A82B-1F23B9906DE6">

<h3>Command history functionality does not work</h3>
<p>
The command history functionality does not work in Admin CLI and
SQL consoles in this release. This is due to an incompatibility with
the jline 3.x library. To get the same functionality as previous
releases, replace the jline.jar that comes with the
Oracle NoSQL Database 18.1.x package with the open source jline-2.14.6.jar.
</p>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<pre>
curl -o $KVHOME/lib/jline.jar http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/jline/jline/2.14.6/jline-2.14.6.jar
</pre>
[#26941]
<h3>Store with Full Text Search may become unsynchronized</h3>
<p>
A store that has enabled support for Full Text Search may, on rare
occasions, encounter a bug in which internal components of a master
Replication Node become unsynchronized, causing updates from that
Replication Node to stop flowing to the Elasticsearch engine.  This
problem will cause data to be out of sync between the store and
Elasticsearch.
</p>
<p>
When the problem occurs, the Elasticsearch indices stop being populated.
The problem involves the shutdown of the feeder channel for a component
called the TextIndexFeeder, and is logged in the debug logs for the
Replication Node.  For example:
</p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>
If the TextIndexFeeder channel is shutdown, then the user can restore it
by creating a dummy full text search index.  Here is an example of how
you can do that.
</p>
<p>
Assuming that Elasticsearch is already registered, execute the
following commands from the Admin CLI:
</p>
<pre>
execute 'CREATE TABLE dummy (id INTEGER,title STRING,PRIMARY KEY (id))'

execute 'CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX dummytextindex ON dummy (title)'

execute 'DROP TABLE dummy'
</pre>
<p>
Note that <i>dummy</i> is the name of a temporary table that should not
exist previously.
</p>
<p>
Creating a full text search index reestablishes the channel from the
store to Elasticsearch and ensures that data is synced up to date.

<h3>Key Distribution Statistics Utility is disabled by default </h3>
<p>
Prior to 4.5.x release, Oracle NoSQL Database server automatically
gathered key distribution statistics for its tables as the Key
Distribution Statistics Utility was enabled by default. Depending on the
frequency at which the statistics are gathered and the size of the
store, the gathering of statistics can cause the throughput of the
system can drop. Therefore, starting 4.5.x release, the Key Distribution
Statistics Utility will be disabled by default for all newly created
stores. Note that the utility will remain enabled for stores upgrading
to 4.5.x. The user can issue the following command to disable the
utility:
</p>
<pre>
plan change-parameters -wait -all-rns -params "rnStatisticsEnabled=false"
change-policy -params rnStatisticsEnabled=false
</pre>
<h3>Data Verifier is disabled by default </h3>
<p>
Starting 4.5.x, the data verifier is turned off by default. This change
was made because, in some cases, the data verifier was using a lot of
I/O bandwidth and causing the system to slow down. Users can turn on the
data verifier by issuing the following two commands from the Admin CLI:
</p>
<pre>
plan change-parameters -wait -all-rns -params "configProperties=je.env.runVerifier=false"

change-policy -params "configProperties=je.env.runVerifier=false"
</pre>
<p>
Note that, if the store has services with preexisting settings for the
configProperties parameter, then users will need to get the current
values and merge them with the new setting to disable the verifier:
</p>
<pre>
show param -service rg1-rn1
show param -policy
</pre>
<p>
For example, suppose rg1-rn1 has set the following cleaner parameter:
</p>
<pre>
kv-> show param -service rg1-rn1
[...]
configProperties=je.cleaner.minUtilization=40
</pre>
<p>
When updating the configProperties parameter, the new setting for the verifier
should be added, separating the existing settings with semicolons:
</p>
<pre>
plan change-parameters -wait -all-rns -params "configProperties=je.cleaner.minUtilization=40;je.env.runVerifier=false"
</pre>
<h3>AdminFaultException during partition migration operation</h3>
<p>
Topology operations that expand or contract the store are not supported
when active subscribers are streaming data from the store using the
Streams API. During the partition migration phase of the topology
operation, the system raises a AdminFaultException if it detects active
subscribers.  The details of the exception are logged as a WARNING in
the logs and will read as follows:
</p>
<pre>
Request to migrate &lt;partitionId&gt; was rejected because the node is part of a streaming subscription
</pre>
[#26171]
<h3>Misleading ping output when system is in read-only mode because of out of disk space</h3>
<p>
When a replication node is out of disk space, the system gets into a mode
that only allows read operations. When the system is in this read-only mode,
the <code>ping</code> output may show the shard status as being
<code>offline</code> when it is actually in read-only mode. The user can tell
if the system is in read-only mode if ping output has replication node status
set to RUNNING, UNKNOWN and master status set to RUNNING and the show topology
output has MASTER (non-authoritative).
</p>

<h3>Subscription cannot connect and fails with InternalException</h3>
<p>
If a master transfer occurs due to a failure after the publisher is started
and before a subscriber connects, an <code>InternalException</code>
can occur when the subscriber tries to connect. The exception message
will read "Failed to connect, will retry after sleeping 3000 ms". Restart
the publisher to work around this problem.
</p>
[#26431]
<h3>Error when querying an index on array or map datatype</h3>
<p>
An exception occurs when a query accesses an index that was created
on an array or map column from a table that has a primary key column
of NUMBER or TIMESTAMP datatype. To work around the exception, the
user can use the hints feature described in SQL for Oracle NoSQL
Database so the query processor can avoid that index. Here is an
example of the SQL statements that can cause this problem.
</p>
<pre>
create table foo (a timestamp, array array(int), primary key(a))
create index idx on foo (array[])
select * from foo where array[] >any 10
</Pre>

<h3>Performance overhead for secure store </h3>
<p>
Changed the SSL cipher suites preference order to favor suites using
GCM cipher algorithm mode if no user-specified cipher suite is configured.
In our testing, we have found that suites using the GCM cipher algorithm
mode provide better performance than suites using CBC mode, particularly
on hardware with limited sources of secure randomness.  Note, though,
that performance may depend on the workload and hardware configuration.
