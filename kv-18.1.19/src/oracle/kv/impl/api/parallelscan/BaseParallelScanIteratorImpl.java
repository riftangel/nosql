/**
 * Implementation of a scatter-gather iterator. The iterator will access the
 * store, possibly in parallel, and sort the values before returning them
 * through the next() method.
 * <p>
 * Theory of Operation
 * <p>
 * When the iterator is created, one {@code Stream} instance is created
 * for each single range, such as a shard or partition. {@code Stream} maintains
 * state required for reading from the store, and the returned data. The
 * instances are kept in a {@code TreeSet} and remain until there are no more
 * records available from the range. How the streams are sorted is described
 * below.
 * <p>
 * When the {@code Stream} is first created it is submitted to the thread pool
 * executor. When run, it will attempt to use makeReadRequest() method to read a
 * block of records from the store. The returned data is placed on the
 * {@code blocks} queue. If there are more records in the store, it will use
 * setResumeKey method to save resume key and if there is room on the queue, the
 * stream re-submits itself to eventually read another block. There is locking
 * which will prevent the stream from being submitted more than once. There is
 * more on threads and reading below.
 * <p>
 * Sorting
 * <p>
 * {@code Stream} implements {@code Comparable}. (Note that {@code Stream} has a
 * natural ordering that is inconsistent with {@code equals}.) When a stream is
 * inserted into the {@code TreeSet} it will sort
 * (using {@code Comparable.compareTo}) on the next element in the stream. If
 * the stream does not have a next element (because the stream has been drained
 * and the read from the store has not yet returned)
 * {@code Comparable.compareTo()} will return -1 causing the stream to sort
 * to the beginning of the set. This means that the first stream in the
 * {@code TreeSet} has the overall next element or is empty waiting on data.
 * See the section below on Direction for an exception to behavior.
 * <p>
 * To get the next overall element the basic steps are as follows:
 * <p>
 * 1. Remove the first stream from the {@code TreeSet} <br>
 * 2. Remove the next element from the stream  <br>
 * 3. Re-insert the stream into the {@code TreeSet}  <br>
 * 4. If the element is not null, return  <br>
 * 5. If the element is null, wait and go back to 1  <br>
 * <p>
 * Removing the element at #2 will cause the stream to update the next
 * element with the element next in line (if any). This will cause the
 * stream to sort based on the new element when re-inserted at #3.
 * <p>
 * There is an optimization at step #5 which will skip the wait if
 * removing an element (#2) resulting in the stream having a non-null
 * next element.
 * <p>
 * Reading
 * <p>
 * Initially, each {@code Stream} is submitted to the executor. As mentioned
 * above the {@code Stream} will read a block and if there is more data
 * available and space in the queue, will re-submit itself to read more data.
 * This will result in reading {@code QUEUE_SIZE} blocks for each range. The
 * {@code ShardStream} is not re-submitted once the queue is filled. If reading
 * from the store results in an end-of-data, a flag is set preventing the stream
 * from being submitted.
 * <p>
 * Once elements are removed from the iterator and a block is removed from the
 * queue, an attempt is made to submit a stream for reading. This happens
 * at step #2 above in {@code Stream.removeNext()}. The method
 * {@code removeNext()} will first attempt to remove an element from the
 * current block. If that block is empty it removes the next block on the
 * queue, making that the current block. At this point the stream is
 * submitted to the executor.
 * <p>
 * Thread Safety
 * <p>
 * The implementations of the {@link Iterator} interface used by
 * synchronous/blocking clients are not thread-safe.  Callers are expected to
 * provide their own synchronization.  Synchronous clients do not call the
 * asynchronous API.
 * <p>
 * The implementations of the {@link AsyncTableIterator} interface used by
 * asynchronous clients need to provide a somewhat restricted form of thread
 * safety.  The callers of the API are required to provide external
 * synchronization: {@link AsyncIterationHandleImpl} is the caller and it
 * provides the needed synchronization.  Implementations need to make sure that
 * the interaction between those API calls and the processing of new data
 * received from the server is handled safely.  In this class, that only
 * requires the use of volatile (read) and synchronization (write) for access
 * to the closed and closeException fields, since safe access to element data
 * is already provided.
 * <p>
 * The {@link Stream} nested class documents its own synchronization, which is
 * part of the support for safe access to element data.
 * <p>
 * Subclasses of this class and the Stream class need to provide thread safety
 * between processing results returned from the server and access via calls to
 * AsyncTableIterator API.
