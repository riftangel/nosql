/**
 * Update parameters to disable all the services running on the target storage
 * node. This is purely a change to the admin database.We assume that the
 * target node is already down, and that there is no need to issue remote
 * requests to stop those services.
 *
 * Suppose we are migrating the services on SN1 -> SN20, which causes the
 * topology to change from version 5 -> 6, and suppose that succeeds. The basic
 * steps that occurred were:
 *
 *  1. create a new topo and params
 *  2. broadcast the topo changes
 *  3. ask the new SN to create the desired services.
 *
 * If we repeat this plan, the second plan execution will find that there are
 * no topology changes between what is desired and what is currently stored in
 * the admin db. We placidly accept this and continue nevertheless to do steps
 * 2 and 3, because we do not know whether the previous attempt was interrupted
 * between steps 1 and 2, or whether it succeeded. Because of that, if there
 * are no changes to the topology found, we wil broadcast the entire topology
 * instead of just the delta.
