/**
 * TimeoutSocket provides an efficient implementation of socket read timeouts.
 * The more obvious approach is to have the ClientSocketFactory.createSocket
 * method create a vanilla java.net.Socket, and specify timeouts with
 * Socket.setSoTimeout(). This turned out to be cpu intensive, because the
 * implementation uses a poll system call to enforce the timeout.
 * <p>
 * Instead, the TimeoutSocket provides an isActive() method that lets a timer
 * thread query the socket to see if a read has taken too long. If the socket
 * has a pending read, but has been inactive for longer than the timeout
 * period, the socket is forcibly closed. Timeout monitoring is only in effect
 * if this socket is properly registered with the
 * ClientSocketFactor.TimeoutTask.

 * @see ClientSocketFactory
