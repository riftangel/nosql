/**
 * Defines parameters used in multi-row operations. A multi-row operation
 * selects rows from at least one table, called the target table, and optionally
 * selects rows from its ancestor and descendant tables.
 * <p>
 * The target table is defined by the {@link PrimaryKey} or {@link IndexKey}
 * passed as the first parameter of the multi-row method.  These include
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link TableAPI#multiGet}
 * <li>{@link TableAPI#multiGetKeys}
 * <li>{@link TableAPI#tableIterator(PrimaryKey, MultiRowOptions, TableIteratorOptions)}
 * <li>{@link TableAPI#tableKeysIterator(PrimaryKey, MultiRowOptions, TableIteratorOptions)}
 * <li>{@link TableAPI#tableIterator(IndexKey, MultiRowOptions, TableIteratorOptions)}
 * <li>{@link TableAPI#tableKeysIterator(IndexKey, MultiRowOptions, TableIteratorOptions)}
 * <li>{@link TableAPI#multiDelete}
 * </ul>
 * <p>

 * By default only matching records from the target table are returned or
 * deleted.  {@code MultiRowOptions} can be used to specify whether the
 * operation should affect (return or delete) records from ancestor and/or
 * descendant tables for matching records.  In addition {@code MultiRowOptions}
 * can be used to specify sub-ranges within a table or index for all operations
 * it supports using {@link FieldRange}.
 * <p>
 * When results from multiple tables are returned they are always returned with
 * results from ancestor tables first even if the iteration is in reverse order
 * or unordered.  In this case results from multiple tables are mixed.  Because
 * an index iteration can result in multiple index entries matching the same
 * primary record it is possible to get duplicate return values for those
 * records as well as specified ancestor tables.  It is not valid to specify
 * child tables for index operations.  It is up to the caller to handle
 * duplicates and filter results from multiple tables.
 * <p>
 * The ability to return ancestor and child table rows and keys is useful and
 * can avoid additional calls from the client but it comes at a cost and should
 * be used only when necessary.  In the case of ancestor tables it means
 * verification or fetching of the ancestor row.  In the case of child tables
 * it means that the iteration cannot end until it has scanned all child table
 * records which may involve iteration over uninteresting records.
