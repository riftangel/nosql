/**
 * A JobWrapper is used to present one phase of a multi-phase task as a
 * Callable that can be executed by a executor service. When call() is invoked,
 * the wrapper invokes the doJob() method. The doJob() method will return a
 * NextJob, which holds both the status of the work just executed, along with a
 * possible follow-on phase, and parameters to use in scheduling the next
 * phase. When phase 1 finishes, the follow-on phase will be scheduled.
 *
 * For example, suppose a task wants to
 *  - phase 1: invoke a partition migration
 *  - phase 2: check migration status
 * then the doJob() method would invoke phase 1 and return a {@link NextJob}
 * that encases phase 2.
