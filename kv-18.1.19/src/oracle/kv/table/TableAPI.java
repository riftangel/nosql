/**
 * TableAPI is a handle for the table interface to an Oracle NoSQL
 * store. Tables are an independent layer implemented on top
 * of the {@link KVStore key/value interface}.  While the two interfaces
 * are not incompatible, in general applications will use one or the other.
 * To create a TableAPI instance use {@link KVStore#getTableAPI getTableAPI()}.
 * <p>
 * The table interface is required to use secondary indexes and supported data
 * types.
 * <p>
 * Tables are similar to tables in a relational database.  They are named and
 * contain a set of strongly typed records, called rows.  Rows in an Oracle
 * NoSQL Database table are analogous to rows in a relational system and each
 * row has one or more named, typed data values.  These fields can be compared
 * to a relational database column.  A single top-level row in a table is
 * contained in a {@link Row} object.  Row is used as return value for TableAPI
 * get operations as well as a key plus value object for TableAPI put
 * operations. All rows in a given table have the same fields.  Tables have a
 * well-defined primary key which comprises one or more of its fields, in
 * order.  Primary key fields must be simple (single-valued) data types.
 * <p>
 * The data types supported in tables are well-defined and include simple
 * single-valued types such as Integer, String, Date, etc., in addition to
 * several complex, multi-valued types -- Array, Map, and Record.  Complex
 * objects allow for creation of arbitrarily complex, nested rows.
 * <p>
 * All operations on this interface include parameters that supply optional
 * arguments to control non-default behavior.  The types of these parameter
 * objects varies depending on whether the operation is a read, update,
 * or a multi-read style operation returning more than one result or an
 * iterator.
 * <p>
 * In order to control, and take advantage of sharding across partitions tables
 * may be defined in a hierarchy.  A top-level table is one without a parent
 * and may be defined in a way such that its primary key spreads the table rows
 * across partitions.  The primary key for this sort of table has a
 * <em>complete</em> shard key but an empty minor key.  Tables with parents
 * always have a primary key with a minor key.  The primary key of a child
 * table comprises the primary key of its immediate parent plus the fields
 * defined in the child table as being part of its primary key.  This means
 * that the fields of a child table implicitly include the primary key fields
 * of all of its ancestors.
 * <p>
 * Some of the methods in this interface include {@link MultiRowOptions} which
 * can be used to cause operations to return not only rows from the target
 * table but from its ancestors and descendant tables as well.  This allows
 * for efficient and transactional mechanisms to return related groups of rows.
 * The MultiRowOptions object is also used to specify value ranges that apply
 * to the operation.
 *
 * Iterators returned by methods of this interface can only be used safely
 * by one thread at a time unless synchronized externally.

     * the store is currently executing an operation that is the logical
     * equivalent of the action specified by the statement, the method will
     * return an ExecutionFuture that serves as a handle to that operation,
     * rather than starting a new invocation of the command. The caller can use
     * the ExecutionFuture to await the completion of the operation.
     * <pre>
     *   // process A starts an index creation
     *   ExecutionFuture futureA =
     *       tableAPI.execute("CREATE INDEX age ON users(age)");
