/**
 * An index iteration that returns keys.  The index is specified by a
 * combination of the indexName and tableName.  The index scan range and
 * additional parameters are specified by the IndexRange.
 * <p>
 * Both primary and secondary keys are required for resumption of batched
 * operations because a single index match may match a large number of
 * primary records. In order to honor batch size constraints a single
 * request/reply operation may need to resume within a set of duplicates.
 * <p>
 * Unless ancestor return values are requested this operation returns only that
 * information which is available in the index itself avoiding extra fetches.
 * When an ancestor table is requested the operation will minimally verify that
 * the ancestor key exists in order to add it to the returned list.  Ancestor
 * keys are returned before the corresponding target table key.  This is true
 * even if the iteration is in reverse order.  In the event of multiple index
 * entries matching the same primary entry and/or ancestor entry, duplicate keys
 * will be returned.
 * <p>
 * The childTables parameter is a list of child tables to return. These are not
 * supported in R3 and will be null.
 * <p>
 * The ancestorTables parameter, if not null, specifies the ancestor tables to
 * return in addition to the target table, which is the table containing the
 * index.
 * <p>
 * The resumeSecondaryKey parameter is used for batching of results and will be
 * null on the first call
 * <p>
 * The resumePrimaryKey is used for batching of results and will be null
 * on the first call
 * <p>
 * The batchSize parameter is the batch size to to use
 *
