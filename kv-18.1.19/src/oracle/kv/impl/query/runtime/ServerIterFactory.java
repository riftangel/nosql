/**
 * An interface to construct iterators that must exist at the server only (because
 * they make use of server-side classes). 
 *
 * For example, consider BaseTableIter. The compiler creates an instance T of
 * BaseTableIter, which is a class visible in both client and server code. During
 * the open() method on T, TableIterFactory.createTableIter() is called to create
 * an instance TC of ServerTableIter. A ref to TC is stored in T, and the next(),
 * reset(), and close() methods on T are propagated to TC.
 *
 * ServerIterFactoryImpl (in the query/runtime/server dir) implements
 * ServerIterFactory. An instance of ServerIterFactoryImpl is created during
 * TableQueryHandler.execute() and is stored in the RCB.
