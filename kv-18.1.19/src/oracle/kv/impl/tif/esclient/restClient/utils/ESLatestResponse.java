/**
 * A utility classs to maintain the latest response for TimeOrderedResponses.
 * 
 * The getResponse call will block if no response was set ever.
 * 
 * In future this can change to use a stack with a backlog size, if required.
 * 
 * Currently only one the latest state suffices.
 * 
 * This class is currently only used to maintain the, most recent state of
 * available ES nodes.
 * 
 * It is updated by ESNodeMonitor which fetches the Node status from ES
 * periodically.
 * 
 * ESNodeMonitor also serves as FailureListener for ESHttpClient. OnFailure
 * also updates the ESNodeStatus as failureListener is mostly notified because
 * of an unresponsive ES Node.
 * 
 * The state needs to be atomically updated.
