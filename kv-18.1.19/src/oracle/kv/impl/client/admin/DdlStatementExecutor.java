/**
 * The DdlStatementExecutor manages resources needed for execution of ddl
 * statements. It provides:
 * - a discovery service to locate the admin master
 * - maintains a handle to the ClientAdminService for RMI communication between
 *   the client and Admin node
 * - manages notifications for ddl operation completion by
 *     - providing an Executor to handle tasks to poll for statement completion
 *     - manages notifications of threads that are awaiting statement completion
 *
 * For each KVStoreImpl, there is a single DdlStatementExecutor per TableAPI.
 *
 * Notification mechanism
 * ----------------------
 * By intent, this class does not automatically maintain a cache of
 * ExecutionFuture instances.  Although DdlFuture, which is the implementation
 * of the ExecutionFuture interface is thread safe, multiple threads may
 * instantiate futures that target the same ddl operation. See the diagram in
 * {@link DdlFuture}.
 *
 * This class does cache the DdlFuture if the future has instigated polling for
 * operation completeness.  Polling is started lazily; it's initiated by a call
 * to DdlFuture.get() or get(time, unit). At that point the DdlFuture calls
 * DdlStatementExecutor to ask for polling to start. DdlStatementExecutor
 * manages the polling requests from multiple futures and ensures that only a
 * single periodic polling task is created per plan. Each DdlFuture that has
 * requested polling registers itself as an interested party for that
 * plan. When plan completion is detected, or an error occurs, the polling task
 * will release all registered DdlFutures.
 *
 * For example:
 *   threadA calls DdlFutureA.get()
 *        DdlStatementExecutor caches DdlFutureA
 *        DdlStatementExecutor creates and submits polling task X
 *        DdlStatementExecutor notes that taskX should notify DdlFutureA
 *   threadB calls DdlFutureB.get()
 *        DdlStatementExecutor caches DdlFutureB
 *        DdlStatementExecutor notes that taskX should notify DdlFutureA and
 *                      DdlFutureB
 * Futures are only cached if the application has called get() and is polling.
 * For synchronization simplicity, cached futures rely on the polling task to
 * free them from the target pool.  If DdlFuture obtains a new status directly,
 * via DdlFuture.updateStatus or isDone(), the new status is applied only to
 * that future instance, and does not affect its own membership in the
 * notification pool, nor the status of any other futures that are focused on
 * the same plan.
 *
 * Synchronization hierarchy:
 * --------------------------
 *  The order of locking is DdlStatementExecutor, followed by DdlFuture.
