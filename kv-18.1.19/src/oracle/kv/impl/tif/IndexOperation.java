     * equal to the number of chars in the strings.
     *
     * We follow ES's BulkProcessor class's precedent for determining this
     * value, which is simply the length of an IndexRequest's payload "source"
     * field (represented in this class by "document") plus a fudge factor of
     * 50, which is referred to as REQUEST_OVERHEAD.
     *
     * It isn't clear what this REQUEST_OVERHEAD represents.  Possibly it
     * compensates for the lengths of the other fields in the IndexRequest: the
     * index name, type and id.  If that were known to be true then we could be
     * more precise, since we have those fields here in this object.  But then,
     * BulkProcessor also has this information and yet chooses to use a
     * constant fudge factor.

     * This number does not need to be perfectly precise, so I am not
     * going to research this any further!
