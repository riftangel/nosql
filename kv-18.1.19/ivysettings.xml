<!-- ======================================================================
This is the Ivy settings file for public builds, using the format defined by
Ivy.

This file is also used by the Ivy via the ivy:retrieve target in build.xml
which resolves dependencies for the NoSQL DB build.  Libraries are retrieved
on demand and are placed in kv/kvstore/lib/kv-external and are not checked
into the kv repository itself.
