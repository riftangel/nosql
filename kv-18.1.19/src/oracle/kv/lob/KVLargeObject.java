/**
 * The KVLargeObject interface defines the operations used to read and write
 * Large Objects (LOBs) such as audio and video files. As a general rule, any
 * object larger than 1 MB is a good candidate for representation as a LOB. The
 * LOB API permits access to large values, without having to materialize the
 * value in its entirety by providing streaming APIs for reading and writing
 * these objects.
 * <p>
 * A LOB is stored as a sequence of chunks whose sizes are optimized for the
 * underlying storage system. The chunks constituting a LOB may not all be the
 * same size. Individual chunk sizes are chosen automatically by the system
 * based upon its knowledge of the underlying storage architecture and
 * hardware. Splitting a LOB into chunks permits low latency operations across
 * mixed work loads with values of varying sizes. The stream based APIs serve
 * to insulate the application from the actual representation of the LOB in the
 * underlying storage system.
 * <p>
 * The methods used to read and write LOBs are not atomic.
 * Relaxing the atomicity requirement permits distribution of chunks across the
 * entire store. It's the application's responsibility to coordinate operations
 * on a LOB. The implementation will make a good faith effort to detect
 * concurrent modification of an LOB and throw
 * <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code> when it detects such
 * concurrency conflicts but does not guarantee that it will detect all such
 * conflicts. The safe course of action upon encountering this exception in the
 * context of conflicting write operations is to delete the LOB and replace it
 * with a new value after fixing the application level coordination issue that
 * provoked the exception.
 * <p>
 * Failures during a LOB write operation result in the creation of a
 * <code>partial</code> LOB. The LOB value of a <code>partial</code> LOB is in
 * some intermediate state, where it cannot be read by the application;
 * attempts to <code>getLOB</code> on a partial LOB will result in a
 * <code>PartialLOBException</code>. A partial LOB resulting from an incomplete
 * <code>putLOB</code>, <code>deleteLOB</code> or <code>appendLOB</code>
 * operation can be repaired by retrying the corresponding failed
 * <code>putLOB</code>, <code>deleteLOB</code> or <code>appendLOB</code>
 * operation. Or it can be deleted and a new key/value pair can be created in
 * its place. The documentation associated with individual LOB methods
 * describes their behavior when invoked on partial LOBs in greater detail.
 * <p>
 * LOBs, due to their representation as a sequence of chunks, must be accessed
 * exclusively via the LOB APIs defined in this interface. The family of
 * <code>KVStore.get</code> methods when applied to a LOB key will be presented
 * with a value that is internal to the KVS implementation and cannot be used
 * directly by the application.
 * <p>
 * Keys associated with LOBs must have a trailing suffix string (as defined by
 * {@link KVStoreConfig#getLOBSuffix}) at the end of their final Key component.
 * This requirement permits non-LOB methods to check for inadvertent
 * modifications to LOB objects.
 * <p>
 * All methods in this class verify that the key used to access LOBs meets this
 * trailing suffix requirement and throw <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>
 * if the verification fails. The use of the name <code>lobKey</code> for the
 * key argument in the method signatures below emphasizes this requirement.
 * <p>
 * Here is a summary of LOB related key checks performed across all methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * All non-LOB write operations check for the absence of the LOB suffix as part
 * of the other key validity checks. If the check fails it will result in a
 * IllegalArgumentException.</li>
 * <li>
 * All non-LOB read operations return the associated opaque value used
 * internally to construct a LOB stream.</li>
 * <li>
 * All LOB write and read operations in this interface check for the presence
 * of the LOB suffix. If the check fails it will result in an
 * IllegalArgumentException.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * The following simplified code fragment loads an mp3 file named "f1.mp3" into
 * the store associating it with the key "f1.lob". Note that this interface is
 * a superinterface for {@link oracle.kv.KVStore}, so to access the LOB methods
 * you simply create and use a KVStore handle.
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * File file = new File(&quot;f1.mp3&quot;);
 *
 * FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);
 * Version version = store.putLOB(Key.createKey(&quot;f1.lob&quot;),
 *                                fis,
 *                                Durability.COMMIT_WRITE_NO_SYNC,
 *                                5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The following simplified code fragment retrieves the LOB that was loaded
 * above and computes its size:
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * InputStreamVersion istreamVersion =
 *     store.getLOB(Key.createKey(&quot;f1.lob&quot;),
 *                  Consistency.NONE_REQUIRED,
 *                  5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
 *
 * InputStream stream = istreamVersion.getInputStream();
 * int byteCount = 0;
 * while (stream.read() != -1) {
 *     byteCount++;
 * }
 * </pre>
