/**
 * Defines the interface for management of login sessions.
 * <p>
 * A login session is a record of a user authentication operation to a
 * KVStore instance that tracks the identity of the authenticated user, the
 * authorized capabilities for that user, plus information about the lifetime
 * of the session.  When an operation is requested by an application, it sends
 * along a Login Token, which includes an ID value for the session.  This allows
 * the component that is processing the request to determine whether the request
 * is authorized.  If the session id doesn't identify an active session, or if
 * the authorized user capabilities for the session don't allow the action to
 * be performed, the request is rejected.
 * <p>
 * Sessions normally have a limited duration of validity, which is referred to
 * as the session lifetime. Some SessionManagers may support an unlimited
 * lifetime for sessions, which is signaled by a lifetime of 0.  Unless action
 * is taken to extend the lifetime of a session (through the
 * updateSessionExpiration method), an action expires at the end of its lifetime
 * and will normally become inaccessible.
