/**
 * KVStore is the handle to a store that is running remotely. To create a
 * connection to a store, request a KVStore instance from
 * {@link KVStoreFactory#getStore KVStoreFactory.getStore}.
 *
 * <p>
 * A handle has thread, memory and network resources associated with it.
 * Consequently, the {@link KVStore#close} method must be invoked to free up
 * the resources when the application is done using the KVStore.
 * <p>
 * To minimize resource allocation and deallocation overheads, it's best to
 * avoid repeated creation and closing of handles to the same store. For
 * example, creating and closing a handle around each KVStore operation, would
 * incur large resource allocation overheads resulting in poor application
 * performance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A handle permits concurrent operations, so a single handle is sufficient to
 * access a KVStore in a multi-threaded application. The creation of multiple
 * handles incurs additional resource overheads without providing any
 * performance benefit.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Iterators returned by methods of this interface can only be used safely by
 * one thread at a time unless synchronized externally.
 *
 * <p>There are two groups of common failure types that result in throwing
 * instances of {@link RuntimeException} from methods that have these failures
 * in common: read failure exceptions, and write failure exceptions.
 * These are described below.</p>
 * <h3><a name="readExceptions">Read Exceptions</a></h3>
 *
 * <p>Read operations are executed by the {@code get} and {@code
 * iterator} methods, and their related iteration calls. Examples are
 * {@link KVStore#get get}, {@link KVStore#multiGet multiGet} and
 * {@link KVStore#storeIterator storeIterator}. In addition,
 *  the {@link TableAPI} interface has read methods, such as
 * {@link TableAPI#get table get},
 * {@link TableAPI#tableIterator tableIterator}, etc. All read methods may
 * experience the following failures:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link FaultException} is the superclass of several read exceptions:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>{@link ConsistencyException} is thrown if the specified
 *     {@link Consistency} could not be met, within the allowed timeout period.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>{@link RequestTimeoutException} is thrown when a request cannot be
 *     processed because the configured timeout interval is exceeded.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>{@link RequestLimitException} is thrown when a request cannot be
 *     processed because it would exceed the maximum number of active requests
 *     for a node.
 *     </li>
 *   </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li> Read operations may also fail with a
 * <a href="#securityExceptions">security exception</a> or
 * <a href="#handleExceptions">stale handle exception</a> as described below.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <h3><a name="writeExceptions">Write Exceptions</a></h3>
 * <p>Write operations are executed by methods that modify data, such as {@link
 * KVStore#put put}, {@link KVStore#delete delete}, the other {@code put} and
 * {@code delete} variants, {@link KVStore#execute execute}, etc.
 * In addition, the {@link TableAPI} interface has data modification methods,
 * such as {@link TableAPI#put table put},{@link TableAPI#delete table delete},
 * etc.
 * All write methods may experience the following failures:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link FaultException} is the superclass of several write exceptions:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>{@link DurabilityException} is thrown if the specified
 *     {@link Durability} could not be met, within the allowed timeout period.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>{@link RequestTimeoutException} is thrown when a request cannot be
 *     processed because the configured timeout interval is exceeded.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>{@link RequestLimitException} is thrown when a request cannot be
 *     processed because it would exceed the maximum number of active requests
 *     for a node.
 *     </li>
 *   </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li> Write operations may also fail with a
 * <a href="#securityExceptions">security exception</a> or
 * <a href="#handleExceptions">stale handle exception</a> as described below.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3><a name="securityExceptions">Security Exceptions</a></h3>
 * <p>There are a number of exceptions related to security that can be thrown
 * by any method that attempts to access data. Data access methods all throw
 * instances of {@link KVSecurityException}, which is the superclass of all
 * security exceptions. Common security exceptions are:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link AuthenticationFailureException} is thrown when invalid credentials
 * are passed to an authentication operation.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@link AuthenticationRequiredException} is thrown when a secured
 * operation is attempted and the client is not currently authenticated.
 * </li>
 * <li>{@link UnauthorizedException} is thrown when an authenticated user
 * attempts to perform an operation for which they are not authorized.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <h3><a name="handleExceptions">Stale Handle Exceptions</a></h3>
 * <p>Any method that attempts to access data may also throw a {@link
 * StaleStoreHandleException}, which indicates that the store handle has become
 * invalid. The application should close and reopen the handle.

     * <p>
     * Entries are supplied to the loader by a list of EntryStream instances.
     * Each stream is read sequentially, that is, each EntryStream.getNext() is
     * allowed to finish before the next operation is issued. The load

     * </p>

     * is not loaded into the store by this method; the
     * {@link EntryStream#keyExists} method may of course choose to do so
     * itself, if the values differ.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the key is absent, a new entry is created in the store, that is, the
     * load operation has putIfAbsent semantics. The putIfAbsent semantics
     * permit restarting a load of a stream that failed for some reason.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The collection of streams defines a partial insertion order, with
     * insertion of Key/Value pairs containing the same major key within a
     * stream being strictly ordered, but with no ordering constraints being
     * imposed on keys across streams, or for different keys within the same
     * stream.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The behavior of the bulk put operation with respect to duplicate entries
     * contained in different streams is thus undefined. If the duplicate
     * entries are just present in a single stream, then the first entry will
     * be inserted (if it's not already present) and the second entry and
     * subsequent entries will result in the invocation of the
     * {@link EntryStream#keyExists} method. If duplicates exist across
     * streams, then the first entry to win the race is inserted and subsequent
     * duplicates will result in {@link EntryStream#keyExists} being invoked on
     * them.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Load operations tend to be long running. In order to facilitate
     * resumption of such a long running operation due to a process or client
     * machine failure, the application may use to checkpoint its progress at
     * granularity of a stream, using the
