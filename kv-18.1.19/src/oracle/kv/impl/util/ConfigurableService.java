/**
 * A configurable service is the equivalent of a "process" in the KV Store,
 * except that it does not need to have a one-to-one relationship with a JVM.
 * Multiple services may be started within a single JVM.
 *
 * Description of ServiceStatus enumeration:
 *
 *                    generated by
 * enum               the service?  description
 * ----               ------------  -----------
 * STARTING           yes           Service is coming up, if a RepNode it may
 *                                  be doing recovery/syncup
 * RUNNING            yes           Service is running normally
 * STOPPING           yes           Service is stopping.  If a RepNode it may
 *                                  be performing a checkpoint.  If SNA it may
 *                                  be shutting down managed services
 * WAITING_FOR_DEPLOY yes           If SNA, waiting to be registered.  RepNode
 *                                  is waiting for a configure() call when it
 *                                  is being created for the first time
 * STOPPED            maybe*        an intentional, clean shutdown
 * ERROR_RESTARTING   maybe*        Service is in an error state and restart
 *                                  will be attempted
 * ERROR_NO_RESTART   maybe*        Service is in an error state and will not
 *                                  be automatically restarted.  Administrative
 *                                  intervention is required
 * UNREACHABLE        no            Service is not reachable and it should be.
 *                                  This status is only generated by ping or
 *                                  the Admin
 *
 * Values initialized with "true" are also treated as alerts.  Terminal state
 * comes from isTerminalState(), below.
 *
 * "maybe*" indicates that the service may call its ServiceStatusTracker with
 * the state change but the SNA will also generate it on behalf of the service
 * when it detects the state via shutdown or process failure.  This ensures
 * that alerts are not lost.
