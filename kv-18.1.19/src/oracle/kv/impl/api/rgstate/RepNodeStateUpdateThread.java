/**
 * This thread is associated with a RequestDispatcher on a KV client or a RN.
 * Its primary purpose is to keep the RepNodeState as current as possible, so
 * that the request dispatcher has current information that's used as the basis
 * for making dispatch decisions.
 * <p>
 * The thread also provides the mechanism to take "high latency" network
 * operations involving the setup or repair of network connections and move
 * them out of the request's thread of control. Whenever the RequestDispatcher
 * encounters a problem with a RN it will typically move on to the next
 * available RN that can satisfy the request, leaving it to this thread to fix
 * any problems asynchronously outside of the request's thread of control.
 * <p>
 * The behavior of this thread is slightly different depending upon whether
 * it's part of a client or RN request dispatcher. Since a client can dispatch
 * to any RN in a KVS, the thread scans all connections to an RN on a periodic
 * basis and will resolve any connections that are in error. An RN on the other
 * hand will only dispatch to other members of its rep group in R1. As a
 * result, it only needs to maintain RN state for RNs in its rep group.
 *
 * TODO: pass stats out to Monitor when in an RN. Log when in a client? TODO:
 * Limit the rate of log messages on error?
