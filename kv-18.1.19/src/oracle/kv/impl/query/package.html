This package, and those below it, contain the implementation of the Oracle
NoSQL Database query processor.  This file is for internal documentation
purposes to contain general information about how the code is structured
as well as a way to capture decisions and rationale during design and
implementation.

<h2>Data Model</h2>

Every instance of the data model is a sequence.

A sequence is an ordered collection of zero or more items.

An item is an atomic value or a complex complex value.

There are 9 kinds of atomic values:

integer : 4-byte-long integer numbers 
long    : 8-byte-long integer numbers
float   : 4-byte-long real numbers
double  : 8-byte-long double numbers
string  : sequences of 2-byte-long unicode characters
boolean : sequences of bytes

binary : variable-length sequences of bytes

fixed-binary : 


<h2>Language Specification</h2>

<h2>Code Structure</h2>
Packages include <em>compiler</em> and <em>types</em>
Details TBD
<h3>compiler</h3>
<h3>types</h3>


<h2>Design Decisions</h2>
The format of this section is a list of decisions, where each decision has a
question or issue, a choice, and rationale.  It may also include who was
involved and when the decision was made.

create package file for capturing decisions:
  o do not put KVStore reference in compiled plan, unless absolutely necessary.

<hr/>
<dl>
  <dt>Should Consistency and Durability be part of the API, the DML, or both?
  <dd><b>Motivation:</b>  Usability and potential ability to fully specify
    query parameters in the DML, which may be handy, although not necessary,
    for the query shell as well as REST-style applications.</dd>
  <dd><b>Decision:</b>  API only.</dd>
  <dd><b>Rationale:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>it is implicitly in the API already in the form of default values
      in the KVStoreConfig used to create the KVStore instance.</li>
      <li>putting it in the DML adds complexity, as well as the need to specify
      a priority order when a property is specified in multiple ways.  It can
      be added to the DML if it becomes necessary.</li>
      <li>the query shell will include the ability to set and modify default
      values.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dd><b>Who:</b>  Sam, George, Markos, Cezar.</dd>
  </dt>

  <hr/>
  <dt>Should a compiled query plan contain a reference to the KVStore instance
    used to compile it?
  <dd><b>Motivation:</b>  Doing this would tightly bind the compiled query to
    a specific transient instance of a store.  This makes possible the pattern
    of compiledQuery.execute() vs KVStore.execute(compiledQuery).</dd>
  <dd><b>Decision:</b>  No.</dd>
  <dd><b>Rationale:</b> This pattern is not typical of the rest of the KVStore
    API and creating this binding without a functional (vs aesthetic) rationale
    may constrain future implementation and design choices.
  </dd>
  <dd><b>Who:</b>  Sam, George, Markos, Cezar.</dd>
  </dt>

  <hr/>
  <dt> Should a batch API be supported?
  <dd><b>Motivation:</b>  Used for efficient support of multiple, related update
    operations.</dd>
  <dd><b>Decision:</b>  Not until we support updates, but yes.</dd>
  <dd><b>Who:</b>  Sam, George, Markos, Cezar.</dd>
