/**
 * Monitoring APIs are executed asynchronously.
 * 
 * For now, the only use case for a monitoring client is to serve
 * ESNodeMonitor. And that function is as follows:
 * 
 * <li>Execute GetHttpNodesRequest asynchronously.</li> 
 * <li>onSuccess of this asynchronous execution, wrap the RestResponse in a
 * TimeOrderedResponse,thereby time stamping it.</li> 
 * <li>Try setting this TimeOrderedResponse to an ESLatestResponse instance 
 * called latestAvailableNodes. </li>
 * <li> Then build a GetHttpNodeResponse from the
 * RestResponse which got set as latest. </li>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Monitoring Client work over a different low level ESHttpClient, than the
 * ESRestClient.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is preferable to use a different MonitorinClient for a different
 * monitoring request type.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Currently Async responses are not queued anywhere for consumption by other
 * thread. The current use case is only to store the latest state of available
 * ES Nodes. This class only specializes to this particular requirement.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In future, when more use cases arise, this class will be generalized
 * accordingly.
